    <p>Over the last 10 years, John Hennessey has received thousands of emails from performance enthusiasts
        from around the world asking the question: Where can I go to learn how to modify cars?
        And the answer was clear that there just wasn’t a place where people could go and learn the fundamental’s of auto performance tuning.
        Simply put, the people in the industry who knew how to modify cars either taught themselves or learned by working around others who had the know how.
        The problem with being self taught is that it’s a long and expensive process of trial and error.
        And for those who learned from others, it took a long time to gain the knowledge and skills.</p>
